# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



 
## Kullanılan Teknolojiler 
- Libraries such as **Bootstrap**, **Tailwind CSS** and **DaisyUI** are used for the style of the application.
- Global state management was preferred to easily display the user name on the screen, and the **Zustand** library was used for this purpose.
- **Moment** library is used to format dates easily.
- **Firebase** is used for database.
